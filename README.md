- **Follow/Unfollow Users**: Connect with other users and view their posts on your feed.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.
- **Secure**: Data encryption, secure passwords, and protected routes.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Redux (for state management), Axios (for API calls), CSS (for styling)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Real-Time Features**: WebSockets (Socket.io) for real-time communication
- **Hosting**: [Your Hosting Provider] (e.g., Heroku, Vercel, AWS)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/likeflames.git
   cd likeflames
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   - For the backend:
     ```bash
     cd server
     npm install
     ```

   - For the frontend:
     ```bash
     cd ../client
     npm install
     ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following variables:
     ```env
     MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-uri
     JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
     PORT=5000
     ```

4. **Run the application**:

   - Start the backend:
     ```bash
     cd server
     npm run dev
     ```
